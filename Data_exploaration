Data exploration of table containing Covid deaths and Vaccination throughout the world
Possible things we can observe in the data exploaration
	* Attribute, their significance
	* Death percentage over total cases, cumulative deaths count and new cases, date of max and min of death and many more
	* Vaccination percentage over population, cumulative vaccination, observation of death with vaccination and many more
	* Join the table of vaccination and death to increase the scope of the data exploration on covid
	* Demonstrate the join,cte,temp table and creating view
